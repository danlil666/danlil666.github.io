      <p class="abstract">
        The digital codification and measurement of food preparation has made strong contributions to HCI food research,
        whether through ingredient manipulation, workflow management, or recipe interaction. But prior work has shown
        that technical developments that emphasize precise gourmet practices tend to overlook the importance of cultural
        knowledge. Drawing on an integrative autobiographical design approach, we describe an open-source hardware
        toolkit that we developed to examine the process of integrating precision techniques with ritual cooking
        practices across three recipes: flour skin, rice wine, and doufu. Our work points to the importance of
        understanding precision as a cultural process with roots in personal and familial experience. We end with a
        reflection on the particular knowledge-forms that come from cultivating cultural relationships to fabrication
        processes and their implications for reading digital fabrication processes as meaningfully relational.
