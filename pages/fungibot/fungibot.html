      <p class="abstract">
        Working with living materials allows us to reshape patterns of consumption and production.
        Mycelium is one such living material that participates in decomposing biomass and redistributing the nutrients
        to reconstruct the surrounding environment. By caring for living mycelium in biowaste, we can make structural
        mycelium biocomposite materials. We introduce a novel method for directly 3D printing mycelium biocomposites
        without the need for molds or tooling. Our method comprises three main contributions: Mycofluid, a
        mycelium-inoculated paste that uses spent coffee grounds; Fungibot, a custom hardware system for 3D printing
        biopastes like Mycofluid; and a method for incubating mycelial growth within fresh 3D prints resulting in
        mycelium biocomposite parts. We illustrate our contributions through a series of objects showcasing our method
        and the material qualities of the parts. Notably, we demonstrate how living mycelium can fuse separate prints,
        enabling complex geometries that are otherwise challenging to 3D print as one part.

      <p>I built Fungibot, a toolhead compatible with Jubilee, to print biopaste.</p>

      <p>I drank a lot of coffee and I collected the coffee grounds. I used these coffee grounds to make a 3D printable
        biopaste and then I grew mushroom on printed biopaste. This makes a mycelium biocomposite that smells like coffee.</p>

      <p>A cool thing about mycelium is that it is living. It grows exponentially across any surface it touches by developing
        hyphal network filling all the void space. If we put two surfaces with living mycelium together, the interface will be
        colonized by mycelium, leading to bio-welding.</p>
